- summary: what the change did, in one short line.
- explanation: what the change does and why, in at most three sentences.
- paths: the files the change touched.
- code: the lines of the change that matter most, copied from it, at most 12.
- why_it_matters: what the change does for the code, in one or two sentences.
- not_checked: one thing the diff does not show.
- architecture: when the change is structural, a short section on how it changes the code's structure, before and after, and why: modules, types, interfaces or files added, removed, moved or split, or a change in which parts call or depend on which. Read it with the earlier cards' summaries, so that a structural change spread over several cards counts. Otherwise exactly "structural: none".
- quiz.text: one question on the change's logic or design that the diff answers, such as why the code works this way, what a line does, or what would break without it. Never ask whether a command, test or check will pass.
- quiz.options: 3 or 4 options, the right one at a random place. Each wrong option is something the code could plausibly have done instead, of the right option's length and tone, so the wording gives nothing away.
- quiz.options[].why: one line on why that option is right or wrong.
- quiz.key: the place of the right option in quiz.options, counting from 0.
- brief: the brief so far, updated with this change: what the session set out to do, what it has done, oldest first, and what is still open, in a few short lines. Keep what still holds. Its last line says what this change did.

When the change is not a diff but the agent's workers with the summaries of their cards, the agent changed nothing itself and handed the work to them: the card explains what it split up among them, what came back and what is still open, paths and code are empty, and the quiz is on how the work was split.
