# Studio

The control room's app (map #266, spec #328), for macOS. This version shows one line in its pane: the last step of the Claude Code session you prompted last, live.

- `plugin/`: the Claude Code plugin. On ten hook events it runs `studio-hook`.
- `hook/`: `studio-hook`, which appends each hook payload as one line to the event log, and the log's path.
- `core/`: the studio core, plain Rust with no I/O. The app replays the whole log through it at start, then feeds it each new line.
- `src-tauri/`: the app's Rust shell. `ui/`: its TypeScript pane.

## Build

Needs Node and the Rust toolchain.

    cd apps/studio
    npm ci
    npm run tauri build

This builds `target/release/bundle/macos/Studio.app` with an ad-hoc signature (`codesign -dv` shows `Signature=adhoc`), and `target/release/studio-hook`, which the plugin runs. Open the app with `open target/release/bundle/macos/Studio.app`.

`cargo test` runs the core's replay tests. It leaves out the shell, which needs `dist/` from `npm run build`.

## Load the plugin

Add the plugin folder to `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS` in your shell profile:

    export CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS=/Users/danielrispler/work/Falinks/apps/studio/plugin

Each `claude` session then loads the plugin in place, as `falinks-studio@inline` in `claude plugin list`. Nothing is written to `~/.claude/settings.json`. `claude plugin install` would write `enabledPlugins` and `extraKnownMarketplaces` there.

The hooks run the `studio-hook` built in this checkout, so build before you start a session. Edits to the plugin take effect at the next session start or `/reload-plugins`.

## The event log

`~/Library/Application Support/dev.falinks.studio/events.jsonl`, one hook payload per line, with two added fields:

- `studio_terminal_id`: the session's `STUDIO_TERMINAL_ID`, when set;
- `studio_received_ms`: when the hook received the event, in Unix milliseconds.

The hooks are async, so Claude Code never waits for them, and they append whether the app runs or not. Two events that fire within a few milliseconds can land in either order.

The log is never rotated. It holds tool inputs and results, file contents included.
