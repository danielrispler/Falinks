//! The studio app's shell (#328, module 9). At start it replays the whole event log through the
//! core, then feeds it each new line live and hands the core's card requests to the card writer. The
//! window lists every session (#369, decision 18) and shows the one Daniel selected: its cards, with
//! their quizzes, his guesses, his ratings and the longer explanations he asked for, which the card
//! store keeps on disk, and its check lines. A session that newly needs Daniel, a new card and a
//! failed worker raise a macOS notification while the window is not focused, and the Dock badge
//! counts the sessions that need him (#369, decision 22).
